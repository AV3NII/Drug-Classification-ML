# Drug Classification with Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository showcases a machine learning project focused on drug classification. The primary goal is to explore the application of various machine learning models for accurate and interpretable drug classification. The project emphasizes the importance of high accuracy and interpretability in the pharmaceutical domain, where decisions impact human health.

## Motivation

Traditional experimental methods in drug discovery are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Leveraging machine learning offers an alternative approach by enabling the analysis of large datasets to predict pharmacological properties. This shift accelerates drug development, making it more efficient and cost-effective. The motivation behind this project is to contribute to accurate drug classification and transparent decision-making, crucial for optimizing treatment strategies.

## Objectives

1. **Exploration of Models:** The project explores various machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), XGBoost, and LightGBM, for drug classification.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The models undergo hyperparameter tuning to enhance their predictive performance.

3. **Performance Evaluation:** The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like macro-averaged F1-Score to strike a balance between precision and recall.

4. **Interpretability:** The study emphasizes the interpretability of the models to ensure transparency in decision-making processes.
